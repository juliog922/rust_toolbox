# Practical Networked Applications in Rust

This project focuses on building a practical networked, multithreaded, and asynchronous Rust application. The end goal is to create a key-value database, offering opportunities to explore:

- The Rust crate ecosystem.
- Concurrent data structures.
- Async programming in Rust.
- Key language features.
- Essential Rust tools.

## Project Overview

The project involves constructing a fully-functional, networked key-value store using best practices in Rust. Along the way, you will work with topics such as:

- **Program structure and maintenance** in Rust.
- Applying **tools like `clippy` and `rustfmt`** to ensure code quality.
- Handling errors effectively following Rust's best practices.
- **Serialization** with `serde` for efficient data storage and transfer.
- Implementing **log-structured storage**, inspired by bitcask.
- **Network programming** using `tokio` and the Rust standard library.
- **Benchmarking** using `criterion` for performance testing.
- Writing foolproof parallel code with the **`crossbeam`** crate.
- Exploring **asynchronous programming** with Rust `futures`.
- Learning how to find the right documentation and crates to solve problems in Rust.

## Key Features

- **Concurrency**: Efficiently handle multiple client requests using multithreading and async Rust.
- **Storage**: Build a simple log-structured storage engine inspired by modern key-value stores.
- **Networking**: Implement robust network communication with async Rust and `tokio`.
- **Error Handling**: Leverage Rustâ€™s rich error-handling ecosystem to write reliable, maintainable code.

## Technologies and Tools

The project will use the following technologies and tools:

- **Rust**: The main language of the project, chosen for its performance and safety guarantees.
- **tokio**: A runtime for writing reliable, fast, and secure network applications.
- **serde**: A framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures.
- **clippy**: A Rust linter to ensure code quality.
- **rustfmt**: A code formatting tool for maintaining consistency.
- **criterion**: A benchmarking library to test and optimize the performance of the system.
- **crossbeam**: A crate for parallel programming in Rust.

## Goals

This project aims to:

1. Build a fully-functional **key-value store** that can handle multiple clients concurrently.
2. Explore the **best practices** for writing high-performance, reliable Rust applications.
3. Implement **asynchronous network programming** and **multithreading**.
4. Gain hands-on experience with **serialization**, **error handling**, and **performance benchmarking**.
